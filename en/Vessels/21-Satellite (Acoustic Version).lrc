[00:00.037] Darkening skies, coming this way
[00:06.451] Falling behind, into nothing
[00:12.771] But if you lead, I will follow
[00:19.118] I will be your Apollo
[00:23.251] Alone in outer space
[00:28.248] Satellite, shine on me tonight
[00:33.479] I will be your gravity
[00:36.731] I will stay and never leave
[00:39.780] My satellite, are you here tonight?

[00:49.097] Take the darkness out of me
[00:52.194] Shine on me
[00:58.679] Shine on me
[01:05.701] Blinded I wait, the end is forming
[01:11.782] You are my fate, give me warning

[02:00.893] Shine on me
[02:10.082] Far across the emptiness I walk the night
[02:16.432] And search the silence in the dark you left behind
[02:22.146] I seek the stars above the worlds to be the guides
[02:28.718] But they all pale against the light in your eyes

[02:47.276] And I won't suppose to know why you walked away
[02:53.403] But I can feel you pushing through beyond the space
